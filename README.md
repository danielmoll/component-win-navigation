# [component-win-navigation](http://economist-components.github.io/component-library/#@economist/component-win-navigation)
> Multi-level navigation of articles.

Given a list of articles in a category/subcategory hierarchy, `Navigation` generates a nested list structure with focus and active states.

State is held within the parent component, and clicking on a child `NavigationItem`s modifies it. The resultant nested list structure is decorated with `--focus` and `--active` classes.
