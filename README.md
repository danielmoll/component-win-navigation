# component-win-navigation

## TODO

- [ ] Write some basic unit tests for each component.
- [ ] Work out how I will handle clicking links, and how I will handle: the active category, active subcategory, HTML displayed, and `this.state`.
- [ ] Create some basic CSS based off Russ' attempts.
- [ ] JSON contains dates which can be greyed out later also forces text to not be links.
- [ ] [NPM or eslint need to fix a bug with estraverse not being installed. Until then we need to install it manually.](https://github.com/EconomistDigitalSolutions/fe-component-devpack/issues/18#issuecomment-142613986)
